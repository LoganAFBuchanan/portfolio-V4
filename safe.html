          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>I designed and built web pages for the website Safe.com. Built tools for Wordpress (using PHP) which allowed other members of the marketing team to create pages through templates that fit the site’s style guidelines. Additionally, I redesigned and implemented new customer feedback forms that were easier to understand and complete. The following are two of the several projects I completed while working at Safe.</p>

          <h2>Project 1: Customer Survey</h2>

          </figure>
          <h2>Issue</h2>
          <p>The transformer gallery is a section of Safe.com that lists all of the transformer components of Safe’s main software product FME. This page was used frequently by prospective customers to see if FME was right for their needs. Unfortunately, the transformer pages did not display enough information about compatibility with FME, and they were not in the same style as the rest of the site.</p>

            <figcaption>The Transformer Gallery before the re-design. It caused several false positives and negative to be submitted.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h2>Process & Design Decisions</h2>
          <p>Initially I took a somewhat radical approach to the redesign by suggesting a sidebar interface that allowed search and navigation functionality. However, this was determined to be too different from the rest of the site’s styling. Eventually, the design settled on a similar but more focused visual hierarchy that allowed the user to find more information about a transformer in a consistent and easily visible location.</p>

          <h2>Result</h2>
          <p>This new design gave the user more information including version compatibility and additional information regarding related transformers and topics.</p>
